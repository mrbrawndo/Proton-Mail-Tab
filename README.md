# Proton Mail Tab
A Thunderbird extension that opens Proton Mail in a tab.

## About:
Proton Mail Tab only displays the Proton Mail web page in a browser tab within Thunderbird. If you would like Proton Mail to appear and synchronize in your main Thunderbird accounts, consider a paid account so that you can use Proton Bridge.

For best results, ensure that Thunderbird's cookie settings are set up to keep Proton Mail's cookies to avoid logging in every time.

## Installation:
- Download a signed xpi file from the Releases page to a location on your computer
- In Thunderbird, click the App Menu (3 bars icon) and open Add-ons & Themes
- Drag the xpi file from it's saved location in your file manager onto the Thunderbird window while on the Add-Ons & Themes/Extensions page
- Confirm the popup and install, you will now have a Proton Mail icon on your main mail toolbar that can be moved as desired in toolbar customization
