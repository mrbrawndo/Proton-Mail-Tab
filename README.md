# ProtonTab
A Thunderbird extension that opens ProtonMail in a tab.

## About:
ProtonTab only displays the ProtonMail web page in a browser tab within Thunderbird. If you would like ProtonMail to appear and synchronize in your main Thunderbird accounts, consider a paid account so that you can use Proton Bridge.

For best results, ensure that Thunderbird's cookie settings are set up to keep ProtonMail's cookies to avoid logging in every time.

## Installation:
- Download a signed xpi file from the Releases page to a location on your computer
- In Thunderbird, click the App Menu (3 bars icon) and open Add-ons & Themes
- Drag the xpi file from it's saved location in your file manager onto the Thunderbird window while on the Add-Ons & Themes/Extensions page
- Confirm the popup and install, you will now have a ProtonMail icon on your main mail toolbar that can be moved as desired in toolbar customization

## Customization:
- ProtonTab does not provide any options interface or otherwise toggleable features. 
- The main release version (protontab-1.1-tb.xpi) uses a nearly white monochrome icon that is best for use with a dark theme or on a dark toolbar.
- The alternative version (protontab-1.1b-AltIcons-tb.xpi) uses a Material Design-like with a grey circle background that should be suitable on any background.
